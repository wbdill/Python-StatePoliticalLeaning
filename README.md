1. POTUS vote (every 4 years)
2. US House vote (every 2 years)
3. US Senate vote (every 2 years - missing every 3rd 2-year cycle)
4. State House vote (every 2 years(
5. State Senate vote (every 2 years - Nebraska is unicameal)
6. State Guernatorial (every 2 years - different years by state and NH, VT are every 2 years)

The `data` folder contains processed data files as an intermediary step.

Subfolders within `data` folder (ex: `POTUS`) contain raw data files from authoritative sources.
